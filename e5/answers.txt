1. Using Central Limit theorem got me a satisfying result.

2. When we reject null, the original t-tets would indicate that the number of weekday comments
 and weekend comments are not the same. 
When we reject null, the transformed t-tets would indicate that the sqrt of number of weekday 
comments and weekend comments are not the same. 

3. The Central Limit Theorem method gives the most accurate answer eventhough we are 
changing the question to compare weekday and weekend values per week and not as a whole,
 but it does meet the normality and variance assumption which is what makes it better in 
 my opinion.

4. None of our tests indicate if weekdays or weekends have more comments but looking at the histogram, weekdays have more comments.
