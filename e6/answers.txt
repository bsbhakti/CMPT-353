1. No, I dont feel like we were p-hacking. We just realised that we were asking the wrong questions 
and changed that to more relevant questions, since we already had the data for instructors, we used that instead.
I am pretty confident in my conclusion that instructors did search more with the new search box.

2. We wouldve done 21 tests if we did T-tests instead of anova. True positive rate wouldve been 0.95^(21) = 0.34, which makes our false positive 
66%
