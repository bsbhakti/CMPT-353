1. I think I got better results with Loess smoothing because our dataset was huge. 
Kalman appeared to be a bit more choppy because it was difficult to decide on covariance values.

2. The accelorometer values can be used to calculate changes in velocity, which can then be used to calculate the changes of position (lat long).

4. The prediction with extremely small variance values for lat and long in its transition matrix is a bit over smoothenes, but still pretty good.
 This implies that our formula for constructing lat,long was pretty accurate.
