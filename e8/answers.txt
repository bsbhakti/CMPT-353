1. kNN classifier did the best job of predicting colors. I think it was the best because colors it
 didnt make any assumptions about independence and normality and is a simple classifier suited for our simple problem.
 LAB color space was better than RGB because its perceptually uniform and because lightness
  and color components are seperated.

2. I think the model is making reasonable mistakes because the wrong predictions are typically places with similar weather patterns.
 Extra features like humidity couldve helped the model make better predictions. Furthermore, adding geographical features like altitude can help as well.
