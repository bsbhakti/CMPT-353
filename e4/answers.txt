1. No, I dont think we should predict temperatures with population density. Looking at the plot, 
there doesnt seem to be any relationship or correlation between the two domains.

2. Copying a file from disk to memory is a time consuming process, so compressed files take 
shorter than uncompressed ones. Additionally, decompression methods are developed to take advantage 
of CPU capabilities, so decompressing files is much faster than the time spent on disk I/O operation.
