1.  
 (1)  reddit 0: 8.99s
  (2) no schema specified and not caching 17.31s
(3) with a schema but not caching   13.85s
(4) with both a schema and caching the twice-used DataFrame 16.27s

2. reading the file is the most time consuming.

3. I used cache after filtering and after doing group by so that both
